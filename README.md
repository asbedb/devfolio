DevFolio is my first major undertaking to build a full-stack web application. Originally conceived as a simple portfolio website, it has evolved into a robust content management system with authentication and self-installation capabilities. The current release supports self-installation, with ongoing optimizations planned for the dashboard and index. The current version is only a preview with a more rounded release to come.
